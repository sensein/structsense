    description: >
      Read the provided {literature} carefully. It contains the questions and the open ended text response from a survey.

      Your task is to do the following: Please do it in two steps.
      First step:
        1. Identify the main themes or categories that emerge from the responses.
        2. For each category, provide a brief description.
      Second Step:
        1. For each response:
           a) Read the text, i.e., questions and open ended answers {literature} carefully.
           b) Assign it to one of the categories from the first step if the response clearly matches that category’s description.
           c) Provide a brief explanation for the assignment in a "reason" field.
           d) If the response does not fit any existing category, leave the "assigned_category" field empty and provide a reason. Do not create new categories.
           e) If a response is ambiguous between two categories, list both and briefly explain in a “reason” field.

      Provide the output in JSON format, see expected output.

    description: >
      Perform concept alignment on the extracted structured information by mapping each "assigned_category" to a matching concept (class) from a given ontology or schema.

      Inputs: {extracted_structured_information}

      Instructions:
        alignment instructions:
          - For each assigned_category in `extracted_structured_information`, find the most appropriate matching concept from an ontology or schema (e.g., NCIT:C159271, schema.org and other related ontologies).
          - Concept alignment means associating a term with a known ontological class or identifier.
          - Use a local knowledge source or indexed search system to retrieve candidate concepts (labels or IDs) where possible and mark in remarks if a local knowledge source is used.
          - Record the matched ontology information for each term:
            - ontology_label - label from the ontology or schema class
            - assigned_category_mapped_to_ontology - iri of the ontology or schema class

      Evaluate the structured output from the alignment agent ({aligned_structured_information}). Assess both the quality of the assigned_category classification and its alignment with the ontology or schema. Assign a `judge_score` between 0 and 1, and append remarks justifying the evaluation.

      Instructions:
        - Analyze the content of {aligned_structured_information} and evaluate how well the assigned_category is classified and aligned with the target ontology or schema.
        - Assign a `judge_score` between 0 and 1:
            - 1.0 = perfect alignment
            - 0.0 = misaligned or invalid
            - Intermediate values indicate partial alignment
        - If necessary adjust the "assigned_category" for "response_text" as well as the "assigned_category_mapped_to_ontology".
        - If user-modified fields (e.g., extracted terms) are present, do not overwrite them. Note their presence and evaluation in the remarks.
        - Ensure the final structure is schema-compliant and retains all original metadata and history.

          - Detect and respect these changes (e.g., altered extracted terms).
          - Do not overwrite user-modified terms.
          - Instead, annotate in remarks that user-defined values were retained and evaluated accordingly.

      Constraints:
        - Preserve all historical data.
        - Ensure outputs are traceable, auditable, and schema-compliant.
